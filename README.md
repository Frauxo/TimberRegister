# TimberRegister
This program let you register timber. You'll register each timber by its dimension, then giving it a specific length in meters, and lastly give a price for each meter.

The program also calculates the total price for all the timber in the given storage. The timber in the register can easily be modified, whether you want to change the length of the given dimension, or if you want to change the price. Different dimensions can also be dynamically removed if needed.
